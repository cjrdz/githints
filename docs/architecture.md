# githints architecture

This document describes how githints is structured, how data flows through it,
and the security/integrity model.

## Overview

githints is a local change log for AI coding agents. It keeps a small SQLite
database at `.githints/store.db`, renders it into markdown under `.githints/`,
and exposes both an MCP server and a CLI for reading and writing entries.

Two writers feed the same store:

- **Agent-driven** — the `record_change`/`record_batch` MCP tools or the
  `githints record` CLI command.
- **Hook-driven fallback** — the `post-commit` hook runs after each commit to
  claim pending agent rows and to add fallback entries for files the agent did
  not fully describe.

A `pre-commit` hook can warn (or block) when staged files have no pending
agent record.

## Data model

The source of truth is `.githints/store.db`, a SQLite database.

### `changes`

Each row is one recorded change.

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `id` | Auto-increment primary key. |
| `file_path` | Repo-relative path to the changed file. |
| `commit_hash` | Empty for pending agent rows; filled by the post-commit hook. |
| `branch` | Branch name captured at record time. |
| `source` | `"agent"`, `"llm"`, or `"fallback"`. Legacy `"hook"` rows are migrated to `"fallback"`. |
| `summary` | Short human description of what changed. |
| `reason` | Optional explanation of why it changed. |
| `diff_stat` | e.g. `+5 -2`, captured for agent rows from the working tree. |
| `diff_hash` | SHA-256 of the unified diff for this file/commit. |
| `agent_id` | Optional session/client fingerprint. |
| `recorded_at` | Authoritative Unix timestamp, set in Go. |
| `hmac` / `prev_hmac` | Hex HMAC-SHA256 chaining the row to the previous one. |
| `clock_tamper_warning` | Set when `recorded_at` jumps backward unexpectedly. |
| `created_at` | SQLite timestamp, for human reference only. |

Indexes exist on `file_path`, `commit_hash`, `branch`, and `recorded_at`.

### `changes_fts`

A virtual FTS5 table over `summary` and `reason`. It is kept in sync by an
`AFTER INSERT` trigger, so `search_changes` is always current.

### `githints_meta`

Small key/value table for durable metadata:

- `last_recorded_at` — highest `recorded_at` written so far, persisted across
  restarts so clock-skew detection survives process restarts.
- `last_verify_at` — timestamp of the last successful `githints verify`.

## Write paths

### Agent path

`record_change` and `record_batch` accept a repo-relative file path, summary,
and optional reason. Before insertion the recorder:

1. Validates the path is local and repo-relative (`filepath.IsLocal`).
2. Scans summary/reason for obvious secret patterns (AWS keys, GitHub PATs,
   private keys, JWTs) and rejects the row if any match.
3. Captures the working-tree diff stat and a SHA-256 of the unified diff.
4. Stamps the current branch.
5. Computes the next HMAC using the integrity key and inserts the row.
6. Re-renders the affected per-file markdown and `CHANGES.md`.

Agent rows are inserted with `commit_hash = ''` and are shown as
**uncommitted** in rendered output until the post-commit hook claims them.

### Hook path

After a commit, `githints hook-run` (the `post-commit` hook):

1. Loads `.githints/config.json` and creates the Ollama client only if enabled.
2. Resolves HEAD and the list of files changed by that commit.
3. For each file (skipping `.githints/`):
   - Claims any pending agent rows for that file/hash.
   - Loads the agent rows already recorded for that file/hash.
   - Compares the sum of agent diff stats to the commit's diff stat.
   - If they match exactly, no fallback is written.
   - Otherwise, asks the local Ollama model (when enabled) for a one-line
     caption of the scrubbed and truncated diff. On any error, timeout, or
     circuit-breaker-open state, it writes a generic fallback row instead.
4. Re-renders markdown for any touched file.
5. Computes a Merkle root over all rows for this commit and stores it as a
   `refs/notes/githints` git note.

### Pre-commit gate

`githints hook-precommit` lists staged files and checks that each has a pending
agent row. If not, it prints a warning. Setting `GITHINTS_PRECOMMIT_BLOCK=1`
makes the hook return a non-zero exit code and abort the commit.

## Rendering

The `hint` package reads the SQLite store and writes two kinds of artifacts:

- **Per-file hints** — `.githints/<file_path>.md` mirrors the source tree and
  shows the last N changes for that file.
- **Root changelog** — `.githints/CHANGES.md` is a repo-wide rollup of recent
  changes, grouped by commit.

Both files are fully derived from the database, so they can be deleted and
regenerated at any time (`githints init` re-creates an empty changelog).

Markdown rendering escapes HTML and markdown metacharacters to prevent
injection when the files are later rendered in an MCP client's webview.

## Local Ollama integration

The optional `internal/llm` package provides a stdlib-only Ollama client for
`/api/generate`. It is created only when `ollama.enabled` is true; otherwise
`NewClient` returns `nil` and no HTTP client is allocated.

Before any content leaves the process, `ScrubDiff` redacts lines from files
matching common secret patterns (`.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa*`, etc.) and lines
containing high-signal credential shapes. The scrubbed diff is then truncated
to `max_diff_bytes` before the JSON payload is built.

The client enforces a strict per-request timeout and an in-memory circuit
breaker: after three consecutive failures or timeouts it stops calling Ollama
for the rest of the process lifetime. Model output is sanitized (one line, no
control characters, no shell metacharacters, bounded length) before it is
returned. On any failure the caller falls back to the existing generic text.

The MCP server exposes the integration through optional `summarize` flags on
`get_diff` and `get_recent_changes`.

## Integrity model

The threat model is an attacker who can modify `store.db` but does not have the
local integrity key.

### Key derivation

On first use, `githints init` creates `.githints/.salt` (32 random bytes,
`0600` permissions). The key is derived as:

```
HMAC-SHA256(salt, git_user_email)
```

If `user.email` is not configured, the key is derived from the salt alone. The
salt is machine-local, so keys are not portable across machines.

### HMAC chain

Every inserted row stores:

- `prev_hmac` — the HMAC of the previous row.
- `hmac` — HMAC-SHA256 over a JSON payload of the row's immutable fields.

`commit_hash` is intentionally excluded from the HMAC payload because
`ClaimPending` mutates it after insertion. All other fields, including
`diff_hash`, are included.

`githints verify` walks the chain and reports broken or missing links, plus
any backward `recorded_at` jumps.

### Clock tamper detection

`recorded_at` is generated in Go (`time.Now().Unix()`) rather than by SQLite so
it can be compared monotonically. If a new row's timestamp is more than
`ClockSkewTolerance` seconds earlier than the previous maximum, the row is
flagged with `clock_tamper_warning = 1` and a warning is printed to stderr.
The previous maximum is persisted in `githints_meta.last_recorded_at` so the
check survives process restarts.

### Merkle root

`integrity.MerkleRoot` computes a SHA-256 Merkle tree root over all rows. The
post-commit hook stores the per-commit root as a git note at
`refs/notes/githints`, giving each commit an external, travel-with-the-repo
fingerprint of its change records.

### Salt rotation

`githints rotate-salt` generates a new salt, re-signs every existing row with
the new key, and replaces the old salt. The existing chain is verified first
unless `-force` is passed.

## MCP server

`githints serve` starts a stdio MCP server using `mark3labs/mcp-go`.

Tools:

- `record_change` — record one file change.
- `record_batch` — record several file changes in one call.
- `get_file_history` — history for one file.
- `get_recent_changes` — recent repo-wide changes; optional `summarize` flag.
- `search_changes` — FTS search over summaries and reasons.
- `get_diff` — unified diff for a file (committed or working tree); optional
  `summarize` flag.
- `get_changes_in_range` — timeline query by `recorded_at`.

The server resolves the repo root from its current working directory, so it
should be launched with `cwd = project root` (project-scoped MCP configs).

## CLI

Commands are implemented in `main.go`:

- `init` — create `.githints/`, salt, and hooks.
- `serve` — run the MCP server.
- `record` — manual agent-style write.
- `hook-run` / `hook-precommit` — called by git hooks.
- `verify` — check HMAC chain and markdown consistency.
- `changes` — query by time range.
- `status` — show store health and pending records.
- `rotate-salt` — rotate the integrity salt and re-sign.
